How to use Bootstrap5 with Vite in Laravel9

### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a free and open-source web development framework. It’s designed to ease the web development process of responsive, mobile-first websites by providing a collection of syntax for template designs.

In other words, Bootstrap helps web developers build websites faster as they don’t need to worry about basic commands and functions. It consists of HTML, CSS, and JS-based scripts for various web design-related functions and components.

Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap.


## Features of Bootstrap


### 1. Easy to Begin With

It is pretty easy, to begin with. Being easy to get started with is probably the first quality that makes Bootstrap very appealing.

### 2. LESS as Well as CSS Files

Bootstrap not only offers LESS files but also includes the old CSS files.


### 3. Easily Customizable

Despite the fact that Bootstrap is designed in responsive 12-column grids, layouts, and components, it is also very easy to customize. Whether you need a fixed grid or a responsive one, it can be made possible by making a few changes. Offsetting and nesting columns are also easy to do in both CPU-based and mobile-based browser grids.


### 4. Responsive Utility Classes

Another prominent feature of Bootstrap is its responsive utility classes. Using responsive utility classes, a particular piece of content can be made to appear or hide only on devices depending on the size of the screen being used. This feature is extremely helpful for designers who want to make a mobile and tablet-friendly version of their websites.


### 5. Components of Bootstrap

Some of the components that come pre-styled in Bootstrap are:

- Drop-downs
- Button
- Navigation
- Badges
- Alerts
- Progress Bar

### 6. Drop-Down Component Menu

The drop-down component menu is a responsive additive feature of a website. To include it in a website, a lot of different plugins, mostly Java-based, are tested. But, via Bootstrap and its easy customizing options, this can easily be done in a matter of minutes.

### 7. Bootstrap Templates

The readily available templates make it easier for inexperienced users to create a website following a simple tutorial or demo available on Bootstrap.

### What is Vite?

### Features of Vite
